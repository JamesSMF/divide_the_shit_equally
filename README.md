#Divide_the_shit_equally

###This light-weight command line applet allows you to calculate money stuffs easily.

Have you ever encountered such a situation:

You, Allen, Alex, and Lily had a fantastic day. However, you paid the lunch, Allen paied for the Uber ride, Alex booked four movie tickets online for Avengers 5, and Lily transfered Allen 40 bucks mistakenly. <br>

You folks want to divide the money equally but it seems so freakingly involved to get a correct amount of money to whom each one should transfer. Probably James, the guy who is super frigging good at maths, will also be stuck by this problemâ€¦ for 30 seconds. <br>



#### Don't worry
